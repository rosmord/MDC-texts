# Papyrus Harris I

Typed by Raymond Montfort.

My friend Raymond Montfort has just sent me this version of Papyrus Harris I. Part of it was already available in JSesh (the parts about Thebes).

This version is an full rendering of the papyrus, with some error correction done.

Now, I need to choose a format to publish it, especially as some parts are available in multiple files.
