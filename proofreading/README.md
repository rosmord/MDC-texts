# Texts for proofreading

We have decided to add a proofreading stage for the JSesh library.

Typing a hieroglyphic text is not always an easy task. If your source is a photograph, some signs may be difficult to read, needing collation from other sources or the original itself; editions can be faulty, etc. And the encoder may (or will) make mistakes. I remember that the entry for Cairo JE 60539 (stela of year 400) missed a whole line!

I have decided to organise the library a little better:

- texts I receive will go in the proofreading folder, in order to be checked;
- after a first check, texts will go in the `text` folder;
- when a very thorough check is performed on a text, it will be written in the text body itself. The best way to perform such check is when actually working on the text.
